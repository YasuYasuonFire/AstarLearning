    <ul className='list-disc'>
        <li>
            <p>Astar Network is a Public Blockchain from Japan</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Multichain Smart Contract Platform</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>Currently, there are many independent Layer 1 Blockchains such as Etheruem and Bitcoin, which have created an intranet situation in the Internet, making interconnection difficult.</div>
    <p>Example:) A process on chain A triggers a process on chain B to be executed.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Astar Network is a blockchain that connects multiple layer 1 blockchains in the Multichain era and aims to be a platform on which applications can be created.</p>

    <h3 className='underline'>Astar Network Features</h3>
    <ul className='list-disc'>
        <li>
            <p>Multichain Application</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>XVM</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>dapp staking</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>XVM is particularly significant, as it allows smart contracts to be deployed in both EVM and WebAssembly environments, enabling ecosystems that would otherwise be divided to work interactively.</p>
    <p>This is also good because WebAssembly-compliant smart contract development makes it easier for engineers with skills in traditional programming languages such as C++ and Rust to enter the Web3 world as well.</p>
    <p>dApp Staking is designed to distribute $ASTR based on the developer's contribution to the ecosystem. It will be updated to version 3 specifications soon.</p>
    <h3 className='underline'>Where does the AstarNetwork get its support?</h3>
    <p>In addition to numerous VC firms, he has received investments from web3 advocate and Ethereum and Polkadot co-founder Gavin Wood and Jutta Steiner, former CEO of Parity and Ethereum's former Chief Security Officer.</p>
    <h3 className='underline'>About Astar Japan Lab</h3>
    <p>A consortium established to facilitate the creation of use cases on Astar and collaboration with web3 startups.</p>
